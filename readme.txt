Insert any HTML/Javascript/PHP code into Wordpress. Perfect for AdSense or contextual Amazon ads. 16 code blocks, many display options.

== Description ==

A simple solution to insert any ad code into Wordpress. **Perfect for AdSense or contextual Amazon ads.** Simply enter any HTML/Javascript/PHP code and select where and how you want to display it (including widgets).

Display Options:

*   Display ad Before Content (before post or page text)
*   Display ad Before Selected Paragraph (0 means random paragraph):
*   Display ad After Content (after post or page text)
*   Display ad Before Title (does not work with all themes)
*   Display ad Before Excerpt
*   Display ad After Excerpt
*   Ad as a Widget
*   Manual - Insert {adinserter AD_NUMBER} or {adinserter AD_NAME} into post or page HTML code to display ad with AD_NAME name or number AD_NUMBER at this position
*   PHP function call `<?php echo adinserter (AD_NUMBER); ?>` - Insert code block AD_NUMBER at any position in template file

Additional Options:

*   Use {category}, {short_category}, {title}, {short_title}, {tag}, {smart_tag} or {search_query} tags to insert actual post data into code blocks
*   To rotate different ad versions separate them with |rotate|

Alignment:

*   No Wrapping (leaves ad code as it is, otherwise it is wrapped by a div)
*   None
*   Align Left
*   Align Right
*   Center
*   Float Left
*   Float Right

PHP processing: Enabled or Disabled

Do not display ad if the number of paragraphs is below limit (used only for position Before Selected Paragraph).

Display ad only for posts published after N days.

Do not display ads to users from certain referrers (domains) e.g technorati.com, facebook.com,... (black list) or display ads only for certain referrers (white list). **Leave referrers list empty and set to Black list to show ads for all referrers.**

Do not display ads in certain caregories e.g sport, news, science,... (black list) or display ads only in certain categories (white list). **Leave category list empty and set to Black list to show ads in all categories.**

For all display positions you can also define Wordpress page types where the ads can be displayed:

*   Posts
*   Pages

For display positions Before Excerpt, After Excerpt, Before Title and Widget you can select additional pages where the ads can be displayed:

*   Homepage
*   Category pages
*   Search Pages
*   Archive pages

You can also disable ads in certain posts. For example, to disable ad block 1 with name Test Block in post put the following HTML code within post or page code:

`<!-- disable adinserter 1 -->`
or
`<!-- disable adinserter Test Block -->`

Ad Inserter is perfect for displaying AdSense or Amazon ads. It can also be used to display various versions of <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/65083?ctx=as2&rd=2&ref_topic=23389">AdSense ads using channels</a> to test which format or color combination performs best.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have activated Ad Inserter. How can I use it? =

1. After activation, click "Settings / Ad Inserter" to access the setup page.
2. Put ad (or any other HTML/Javascript/PHP) code into the ad box.
3. Set the display options.
4. Save settings.


= How can I insert the post category name into my ad code? =

1. Use {category} in the ad. This will be replaced with the post category name.
2. You can also use

*   {title} - Title of the post
*   {short_title} - Short title (first 3 words) of the post title
*   {category} - Category of the post (or short title if there is no category)
*   {short_category} - First words before "," or "and" of the category of the post (or short title if there is no category)
*   {tag} - The first tag or general tag if the post has no tags
*   {smart_tag} - Smart selection of post tag in the following order:
  *   If there is no tag then the category is used;
  *   If there is a two-word tag then it is used;
  *   If the first tag is a substring of the second (or vice versa) then the first tag is not taken into account
  *   If the first and second tags are single words then both words are used
  *   First three words of the first tag
  *   General tag
*   {search_query} - Search engine query that brought visitor to your website (supports Google, Yahoo, Bing and Ask search engines), {smart_tag} is used when there is no search query. You need to disable caching to use this tag. Please note that most search queries are now encrypted.


= How can I rotate few versions of the same ad? =

Enter them into the ad box and separate them with |rotate| (vertical bars around text rotate). Ad Inserter will display them randomly.
Example:

`ad_code_1
|rotate|
ad_code_2
|rotate|
ad_code_3`


= How can I use PHP code for code block? =

Enter PHP code surrounded by PHP tags.
Example:

`<div style="width: 100%;">
Some HTML/Javascript code
</div>
<?php echo "PHP code by Ad Inserter"; ?>`


= How can I insert code block directly into template php file? =

Enable PHP function adinserter for code block and call adinserter function with code block number as parameter.
Example for block 3:

`<?php echo adinserter (3); ?>`

This would generate code as defined for the code block number AD_NUMBER.


= How can I create contextual Amazon ad (to show items related to the post)? =

Sign in to Amazon Associates, go to Widgets/Widget Source, choose ad type and set parameters.
For titles and search terms use tags. For example, the code below would display 5 amazon items related to the post tag - check above for all possible tags.

`<div style="height: 531px;">
<script type="text/javascript">
var amzn_wdgt={widget:"Search"};
amzn_wdgt.tag="adinserter-20";
amzn_wdgt.columns="1";
amzn_wdgt.rows="5";
amzn_wdgt.defaultSearchTerm="{smart_tag}";
amzn_wdgt.searchIndex="All";
amzn_wdgt.width="300";
amzn_wdgt.showImage="True";
amzn_wdgt.showPrice="True";
amzn_wdgt.showRating="True";
amzn_wdgt.design="2";
amzn_wdgt.colorTheme="Default";
amzn_wdgt.headerTextColor="#0000AA";
amzn_wdgt.outerBackgroundColor="#FFFFFF";
amzn_wdgt.borderColor="#FFFFFF";
amzn_wdgt.marketPlace="US";
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://wms.assoc-amazon.com/20070822/US/js/AmazonWidgets.js">
</script>
</div>`


Another example for nice contextual carousel below posts:

`<div style="overflow: auto; width: 100%;">
<script type='text/javascript'>
var amzn_wdgt={widget:'Carousel'};
amzn_wdgt.tag='adinserter-20';
amzn_wdgt.widgetType='SearchAndAdd';
amzn_wdgt.searchIndex='All';
amzn_wdgt.keywords='{smart_tag}';
amzn_wdgt.title='{title}';
amzn_wdgt.width='460';
amzn_wdgt.height='250';
amzn_wdgt.marketPlace='US';
</script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://wms.assoc-amazon.com/20070822/US/js/swfobject_1_5.js'>
</script>
</div>`


= Center alignment does not work for some ads! =

Some iframe ads can not be centered using standard approach so some additional code is needed to put them in the middle.
Simply wrap ad code in a div with some style e.g. left padding. Example:

`<div style="padding-left: 200px;">
ad_code
</div>`
